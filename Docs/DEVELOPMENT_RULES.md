### Git Commit Rules
- **Do not push auto-generated or build files** (e.g., `/Library`, `/Temp`, `/Obj`, `/Build`, `/Logs`, or any `.meta` files generated by Unity).
- Ensure `.gitignore` is properly configured to exclude all Unity-generated files and folders.
- Only commit source assets, scripts, scenes, prefabs, and configuration files relevant to the project.
